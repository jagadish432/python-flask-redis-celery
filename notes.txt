earlier pip was 19.* version and pipenv was 2018.7.1 version in my system.

I ran into problems while doing "pipenv install flask"

so downgraded both pip and pipenv version by running the below commands
pip install pipenv==2018.6.25
pip install pip==18.0 (not worked, so ran this command-> "c:\users\aio-63\appdata\local\programs\python\python36\python.exe -m pip install pip==18.0")
pipenv install

env activated

------------
again same problem occurred in the virualenv as they are again installed with latest versions.

now, ran the below cmds in virtualenv
pip install pipenv==2018.6.25
c:\users\aio-63\.virtualenvs\flask-redis-celery-t2js7x3d\scripts\python.exe -m pip install pip==18.0
